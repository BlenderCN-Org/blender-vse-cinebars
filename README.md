# Cinebars
This add-on provides a drawer in the properties pane of Blender's Video Sequence Editor, that lets you add a letterboxing effect ("cinematic bars") to the project. Also useful for preview cropping in various aspect ratios. Please note - while many people may desire this effect, it is somewhat discouraged in favor of using *actual* video resolutions respective of a target aspect ratio.

Unlike the [Letterbox](http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Sequencer/Letterbox) add-on, it does not scale the video at all. Rather, it adds black bars to the sides of the video (top & bottom or left & right) to "crop" the video to a specified aspect ratio.

## Usage
The "Cinebars" drawer can be easily found in the Tools tab. Simply plug in your desired aspect ratio and click "Generate Cinebars Strip". It will generate 3 strips which you can then move to the top of your timeline.

Ex: to generate 2.35:1 (CinemaScope) bars:
* Enter `2.35` in the Horizontal Ratio slider
* Enter `1` in the Vertical Ratio slider
